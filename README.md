Object-Oriented Programming notes

**Program :** Although derived classes inherit	the	members	of	their	parent	base	class,	they	do	not	inherit	its
constructor	method. A constructor	method	of	the	base	class	is	always	called	when	a
new	object	of	a	derived	class	is	created. Call base constructor with : base keyword.<br>
